# markdown-file-reader-writer
An application that will read a markdown file, extract information, and write to a markdown file or create a flashcard study session

Choose your own path! Either extract information from one markdown file and write it to another markdown file, or take the information from the first markdown file and start a study session with flashcards taken from the information on the file!
